# Ordinary-Differential-Equation

"In mathematics, an ordinary differential equation (ODE) is a differential equation whose unknown(s) consists of one (or more) function(s) of one variable and involves the derivatives of those functions.[1] The term ordinary is used in contrast with the term partial differential equation which may be with respect to more than one independent variable"- Wiki
Matlab is such a usefull tool to study ODE.
